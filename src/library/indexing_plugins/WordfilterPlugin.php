/**
 * WordFilterPlugin is used to filter documents by terms during a crawl.
 *
 * When this plugin is in use, each document summary that is generated by a
 * TextProcessor or subclass during a crawl will be further processed by it
 * pageSummaryProcessing method. First a set of applicable
 * rules is computed base on the url of where the summary came from.
 * (see documentation in factory example for more info on how the
 * applicable rules are determined). Then as part of this
 * processing the summary's title and description are sent to
 * the method checkFilter. Here they are compared against the array of rules
 * $this->filter_rules which consists of a list of rules each of which
 * has a PRECONDITIONS and an ACTIONS field. Actions can either be directives
 * that might appear within a ROBOTS
 * meta tag of an HTML document: NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOCACHE, NOARCHIVE, NOODP,
 * NOYDIR, NONE or can be the word NOPROCESS, JUSTFOLLOW, NOTCONTAINS.
 * The preconditions is checked in the function checkFilter. Details on
 * what constitutes are legal precondition are described in the
 * @see $filter_rules and @see $rules_string documentation.
 * Usually, if checkFilter returns true then pageSummaryProcessing adds the
 * meta words to the document summary and returns. If one of the actions
 * was NOTCONTAIN, then only if checkFilter returned false are the meta words
 * added. The crawl makes use of the meta word info when performing indexing.
 * In the case where the actions contain NOPROCESS the summary returned from
 * pageSummaryProcessing will be false this will prevent any indexing of this
 * document from occuring at all. In the case where the actions contain
 * JUSTFOLLOW, the document won't be stored in the index but links from it will
 * be followed. JUSTFOLLOW has a slightly different semantics than NOINDEX.
 * When NOINDEX is used the document is actually stored in the index
 * (unlike JUSTFOLLOW). If another document links to this document, it can be
 * detected. If at search time a NOINDEX document or a link to a NOINDEX
 * document is about to be returned, the NOINDEX is detected and the result
 * won't be returned. With JUSTFOLLOW since the data is not stored in the
 * index we can't tell if a link pointing to a JUSTFOLLOW page just hasn't been
 * crawled yet or if it is a link to a JUSTFOLLOW page, so links to JUSTFOLLOW
 * pages might appear in the index. One can see this effect by doing a search
 * on site:any. The link that found the p7.html page shows up.
 *
 * This plugin has been created with a dummy list of filter rules. By doing a
 * crawl on the test site contain in the archive
 *     tests/word-filter-test-crawl.zip
 * one can  test how it behaves on those terms. To make use of
 * this plugin on real web data one probably wants to alter the choice of words.
 * This can be done from Admin > Page Options > Crawl Time tab by clicking on
 * the Configure link next to the plugin. Alternatively, one could subclass this
 * plugin in WORK_DIRECTORY/app/lib/indexing_plugins where one has a different
 * array of filter_terms. To get a more sophisticated filtering process than a
 * precondition checker one would override checkFilter.
 * One can also directly modify the code below to achieve these effects, but
 * altering code under the BASE_DIR makes it slightly harder to newer versions
 * Yioop as they come out.

; Below is a set of dummy word filter rules to be used with the zip file
; tests/word-filter-test-crawl.zip . A description of how to carry out this
; test is given there in the readme.txt file in this zip file.
; You should not use these rules on an actual web crawl or you will get very
; minimal results.
;
; The general format of this word filter rule set is a sequence of rule blocks:
; [some_url_or_domain1]
; rule_1
; rule_2
; ...
; [some_url_or_domain2]
;
; Anything on a line after a ';' is also treated as a comment.
; A rule block begins with a url or domain that the rules that follow it are
; to a apply to. urls and domains follow the site format as used in crawl
; options. For example, http:/somesite.com/sub_dir/file or domain:somewhere.com.
; A minus in front of this url can be used to indicate anything but that domain.
; For example, -domain:ca would mean anything but the ca domain.
; The rules given before any [some_url_or_domain] line are applied to ALL
; summaries. When a summaries is being processed, the set of applicable rule
; blocks is determined based on matching the summaries url with
; the rule block urls, then all rules from these blocks are applied. Here is
; an example set of rules which is roughly suitable to return only pages with
; Canadian content on Wikipedia:
; [domain:wikipedia.org]
; -canada,-canadian:NOPROCESS
;
; A filter rule is specified in a single line that contains a ':'
; All lines in a rule file without a ':' are treated as comments.
;
; A rule has the format:
; PRECONDITIONS:ACTIONS
; For example,
; surfboard#2,bikini#0.02,wave:NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW
; As one can see PRECONDITIONS and ACTIONS are comma separated lists where
; whitespace is ignored. A PRECONDITIONS list is said to hold if all of
; its constituent conditions hold. In which case, Yioop's page processor
; will perform each of the actions in the ACTIONS list.
; The condition surfboard#2 requires that the term surfboard occurred
; at least twice in the document. If the value after the # is
; between 0 and 1, such as in bikini#0.02, then the condition holds
; if occurrences of that term (no stemming) make up 0.02 percent of
; the documents total length. Finally, if the condition doesn't
; have a # in it, then it is satisfied if that term appears at all.
; The first character of a precondition can be a sign + or -. The
; condition +surfboard#2 is the same as surfboard#2; however,
; -surfboard#2 means the negation of the condition surfboard#2. That is,
; that surfboard appear in the document less than two times.
; If you want to check for the occurrence of a term like -5degrees in
; a document you can use the precondition +-5degrees.
;
; If all the conditions in a precondition hold then the  WordfilterPlugin
; applies the list of ACTIONS. Possible actions are
; NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOCACHE, NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR, NONE,
; JUSTFOLLOW, and NOPROCESS. These say how the summary
; of whole page should be processed and  most of them correspond to robot
; meta tag directives. We indicate here the non standard directives. The crawl
; makes use of the meta word info when performing indexing. In the case
; where the actions contain NOPROCESS the summary returned from
; pageSummaryProcessing will be false, and this will prevent
; any indexing of this document from occuring at all. This is different from
; NOINDEX which says the document should not show up in the index as search
; time. With NOPROCESS a info about page can show up in the index, if there was
; a link to the page which was processed. NOINDEX on the other hand checks at
; search time to eliminate such links. In the case where the
; actions contain JUSTFOLLOW, the document won't be stored in the index but
: links from it will be followed.
