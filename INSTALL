of your Yioop installation. Click on the admin link,
then the manage crawl link. Type in a description of your

start the Currently Processing and Most Recent Urls sections updating
with info about the current crawl.

button to stop it. The crawl should show up after a delay in the
Previous Crawls table. Their you can choose to resume a crawl,
delete it, or set it as the current index.

back to your installations web page and type a query in the search bar,
the query will be answered with the results from that crawl.
